So this is TOLA, which is the norse word meaning 'to endure', this is a React frontend with a Python and Django REST Framework backend that I did for the Awesome Inc. Bootcamp in 2022.

Goals for this project were to have:

>users
>
>user authentication
>
>user posted maxes in various lifts
>
>responsive programming that do all calculations for you
>
>programming that could be updated by a coach
>
>gym memberships

This project was an incredible experience and has really tested the boundaries of my skills as a software developer, I will continue to update this project and continue to add features that will eventually make it the app I envisioned at the start of this journey into software development.
